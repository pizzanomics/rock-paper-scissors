A simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".

The game is played by clicking the buttons displayed on the screen. It displays the result of each round, keeps score, and eventually displays the overall winner after five rounds.

The game works and the logic is correct, however there are a few additional things I would like to add at a future date:
	* A proper UI that looks good.
	* Code that prevents the user from being able to play once someone reaches a score of 5.
	* A button that resets the game without having to refresh the browser screen.
